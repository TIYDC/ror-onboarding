# Computer Setup

## Hardware

All students must bring their own MacBook laptop. Your MacBook should have a
minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard drive space. Those are minimum specs,
but I REALLY recommend getting 8 GB of RAM.

Here are the current
[MacBook Air models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html) and
[MacBook Pro models](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/).

Your MacBook MUST be running macOS Sierra which is a free upgrade from the mac AppStore.

Do not go with the new, skinny 12" Retina MacBooks.  Their processor will be too
sluggish in a year or two.

There is no commercial software required for the class.

## Software

### macOS Sierra

You'll need to install macOS Sierra if your Mac didn't have it pre-installed or you haven't upgraded already.

1.  Download the macOS Sierra upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macos-sierra/id1127487414?mt=12).
2.  You'll need to sign in to your Mac's 'App Store' with your [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/).
3.  Double-click "Install macOS Sierra" to begin installation.
*WARNING*: The macOS upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Additional Software

As soon as possible after receiving your Mac, run through the following steps.
If you've done a lot of your own configuration, some of these steps may have to
change.  If you run into ANY PROBLEMS, send me an e-mail at: [{{site.instructor_email}}](mailto:{{ site.instructor_email }})

* Install Atom
  * Download Atom from [the Atom website](https://atom.io/).
  * Install and run it.  If you're not familiar with Mac installations, [read more here](mac_installations.html).
  * Click on the "Atom" option in your menu bar (all the way in the upper-left of your screen) and choose "Install Shell Commands."

** Atom is not the best editor, but it has great defaults, if you are already using an editor stick with it, alternatives, are Sublime Text, Textmate, and MacVim **

* Install Google Chrome
  * Download Chrome from [the Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).
  * Install and run it.  This install will work a little differently from Atom, so if you get confused, [read more here](mac_installations.html).

* Install XCode Command Line Tools
